# Nextra

Nextra is a framework built on top of Next.js that allows you to build websites focused on content. It has all the powerful features of Next.js, plus additional features for easily creating content based on Markdown.

# Quick Start

To start using Nextra, you need to first choose a theme:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card arrow title="Documentation theme" href="/en/examples/docs-theme/start">
    <>![Documentation theme](/assets/docs-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
  <Cards.Card arrow title="Blog theme" href="/en/examples/blog-theme/start">
    <>![Blog theme](/assets/blog-theme.png)</>
  </Cards.Card>
</Cards>
